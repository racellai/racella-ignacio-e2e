2. Clone this project
3. Open the folder on your IDE where the project resides. For this project the folder is YOUTUBE
4. On your IDE terminal type "npx cypress open" to launch the Cypress test runner console

Node_Modules folder is not included in the repository as there are too many files in it. Installing Cypress will create this folder and the files in it.
